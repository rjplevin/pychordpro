Verse 1:
He came [Em]dancing across the water
With his ga[D]lleons and guns
[Am7]Looking for the new world
In that palace in the s[Am7]un

Verse 2:
On the s[Em]hore lay Montezuma
With his c[D]oca leaves and pearls
[Am7]In his halls he often wandered
With the secrets of the w[Am7]orlds

Verse 3:
And his s[Em]ubjects gathered 'round him
Like the le[D]aves around a tree
In their cl[Am7]othes of many colours
For the angry gods to [Am7]see

And the wo[Em]men all were beautiful
And the m[D]en stood straight and strong
They of[Am7]fered life in sacrifice
So that others could go [Am7]on

[Em]Hate was just a legend
And [D]war was never known
The [Am7]people worked together
And they lifted many sto[Am7]nes

Verse 6:
They c[Em]arried them to the flatlands
But they [D]died along the way
And they [Am7]built up with their bare hands
What we still can't do to[Am7]day

And she [D]loves me to this day
[Am7]I still can't remember when
Or how I lost my [Am7]way
