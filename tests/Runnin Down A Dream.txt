Verse:

I was [E]flyin'

Yeah I'm [A]runnin' [G]down a [E]dream
That never would [G]come to [A]me
*            G    E   E         G       A 
Workin' on a mystery, goin' wherever it leads
Runnin' [G]down a [E]dream   

Verse:

I [E]felt so good, like anything was possible
I hit [D]cruise control, and rubbed my [E]eyes

The last three days, the rain was un-stoppable 
It was [D]always cold, no sun[E]shine

Yeah I'm [A]runnin' [G]down a [E]dream
That never would [G]come to [A]me

I [E]rolled on, as the sky grew dark
I put the [D]pedal down, to make some [E]time

There's something good, waitin' down this road
I'm [D]pickin' up, whatever's [E]mine
